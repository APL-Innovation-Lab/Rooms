# SLR Calendar Page - Offline Version

## Introduction

Welcome to the offline version of the SLR (Shared Learning Room) Calendar page from the Austin Public Library, captured as of 2024-01-17. This project is an initiative by the APL Innovation Lab in collaboration with Open Austin and various community contributors.

## Why This Project?

The idea is simple yet ambitious: we're dissecting the front-end of the SLR Calendar page to better understand it, improve it, and eventually, revamp the way we handle our online services. It's a starting point for separating the backend and frontend of our web systems, and we're starting here with the SLR Calendar page.

## Your Role in This

We believe in the power of community. Whether you're a code wizard, a curious learner, or someone with fresh ideas, your perspective can make a real difference here. How can you help?

- **Trim and Tweak**: Dive into the code. If you see something unnecessary or that could be done better, go for it.
- **Document and Discuss**: Found something interesting? Document it. Got questions? Let's talk about them.
- **Innovate and Suggest**: Have a bright idea? We're all ears. Share your suggestions and let's explore new possibilities together.

## Getting Involved

Ready to jump in? Here's how:

1. **Fork this Repository**: Make it your playground.
2. **Create Your Magic**: Tinker with the code, explore new avenues.
3. **Pull Request**: Share your improvements back with the community.
4. **Stay in Touch**: Questions, thoughts, ideas? Reach out at bryce.benton@austintexas.gov.

## A Community Effort

This isn't just a project; it's a collaboration. It's about making our digital space more efficient, more user-friendly, and more innovative. And the best part? We get to do it together.
