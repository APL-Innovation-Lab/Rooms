To perform a privacy assessment for the Austin Public Library's Meeting Rooms system, we should focus on the following areas:

1. **Data Collection Review**: Identify all points of data collection (e.g., meeting room bookings, digital services sign-up) and evaluate the types of information gathered.

2. **Data Usage and Sharing Audit**: Examine how the collected data is used internally and whether it's shared with external entities. Ensure all sharing complies with relevant privacy laws.

3. **Consent Mechanisms**: Assess how consent is obtained from users and ensure it's done in a clear and lawful manner.

4. **Security Measures**: Evaluate the security measures currently in place to protect user data from unauthorized access or breaches.

5. **Policy Transparency and Communication**: Review how privacy policies are communicated to users and if they are easily accessible and understandable.

6. **User Rights and Control**: Ensure users have easy access to their data and can exercise their rights over their data, including correction, deletion, and objections to processing.

7. **Compliance with Regulations**: Verify that library practices align with applicable privacy regulations such as GDPR or CCPA, if relevant.
