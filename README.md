# Rooms - Austin Public Library Room Reservations

Welcome to the "Rooms" project, a development version of the room reservation system used by the Austin Public Library for booking Shared Learning Rooms. This repository, a collaborative effort between the Austin Public Library and Open Austin, is a fork of [APL-Innovation-Lab/APL-CMS](https://github.com/APL-Innovation-Lab/APL-CMS).

## Project Overview

The "Rooms" project is an integral part of a broader initiative by the Austin Public Library Innovation Lab, aiming to extend and enhance our production environment at [library.austintexas.gov](https://library.austintexas.gov). This initiative is the first step in a series of projects that build upon each other, with a focus on sustainable and scalable development.

## Open Austin's Recommendations

In alignment with Open Austin's recommendations, we are adopting a strategic approach in developing this project:

- **Splitting Frontend and Backend:** As an intermediate step, we will separate the frontend and backend components of the CMS. This approach will create a more robust and scalable foundation for the "Rooms" project and future initiatives.
- **Building Solid Foundations:** This separation will enable us to establish robust code documentation, including explanations and how-to guides for both technical and non-technical audiences.
- **Ease of Implementation:** The separation is intended to simplify the process for staff to tackle and implement future updates and enhancements.
- **Accessibility and Openness:** Ensuring the project meets accessibility criteria and remains open for contributions from community members, with minimal oversight required from staff.

## Key Components

- **Webform Module:** Foundation for the reservation form.
- **Permissions and Roles:** Access management.
- **Taxonomies:** Rooms and Library Locations.
- **Webform Configuration and Fields:** Customization of the form.
- **Pages and Views:** User interfaces.
- **Webform Validation:** Data validation enhancements.
- **CSS and JavaScript:** Styling and interactivity.
- **Webform Emails:** Notification system.
- **Data Export:** Data management tools.
