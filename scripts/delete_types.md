The `delete_types.sh` script is designed to streamline the Austin Public Library's Drupal website database for specific project developments, in this case, focusing on "Meeting Spaces" which encompass Meeting Rooms and Shared Learning Rooms. This script serves to make the database more manageable and efficient for development purposes by reducing its size and the time required for operations like importing.

Here's a breakdown of what the script does:

1. **Predefine Content Types**: It starts by defining a comprehensive list of content types present in the database. These include various nodes like `accordion`, `event`, `hero_banner_image`, etc., representing different types of content stored in the Drupal system.

2. **Specify Content to Keep**: It then lists the content types that should be retained for the specific project focusâ€”here, anything related to "Rooms". This includes types like `alert`, `article`, `page`, and a few others.

3. **User Interaction Through Menu**: The script provides a simple menu-driven interface to the user, allowing them to choose between preparing the database for room development, displaying all node types, or exiting the script. This interactive approach ensures that operations are clear and controlled.

4. **Database Preparation for Rooms**:
   - The `prepare_for_rooms` function iterates over all content types.
   - It checks if a content type is not in the list of types to retain (`keep_types`).
   - If a content type is not needed, it executes commands to delete all nodes of that type and then attempts to delete the content type configuration itself. This deletion helps in reducing database clutter and size, focusing the database content on what's necessary for the development of room-related features.

5. **Handling Operations**: The script uses `ddev` and `drush` commands for database operations, which are standard tools in Drupal development environments for managing site configurations and content. These include deleting entities and configurations directly through Drupal's command-line interface.

6. **Backup and Maintenance Commands**: Though commented out, the script includes provisions for starting up the development environment (`ddev start`), backing up the database, and shutting down the environment (`ddev stop`). These commands suggest that the script is also concerned with maintaining a safe development workflow by ensuring backups are created before making substantial changes.

The script effectively narrows down the database to essential elements that support the development and testing of new or improved features for Meeting Spaces, making it easier for developers and collaborators to work with a more focused and lighter database. This approach not only speeds up development times but also enhances the collaborative potential by lowering the technical barrier to entry for new contributors.
