# Meeting Room Reservation Code Explanation

This JavaScript code is responsible for handling the meeting room reservation functionality on a web page. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

## Document Ready Function

The code is wrapped in a document ready function to ensure that it runs once the page has finished loading.

## Helper Functions

Several helper functions are defined to retrieve values from form fields, such as the selected meeting room name, start date, start time, and end time.

## UI Setup

The code sets up the user interface by hiding certain elements, creating a space for displaying the selected reservation details, and formatting the selected date and time.

## Form Submission Validation

The code intercepts the form submission with a last-minute validation check. It defines an `update_avail3` function that retrieves existing reservation data for the selected date range and checks for overlaps with the user's requested reservation. If there are no conflicts, it proceeds to check the monthly reservation limit.

## Monthly Reservation Limit Check

The `checkMonthlyLimit` function is defined to verify if the user has exceeded the monthly reservation limit. It retrieves reservation data for the past and future 90 days and checks if the user has already made 3 reservations within that timeframe. If the limit is not exceeded, the form is submitted.

## Meeting Room Selection

The code dynamically populates the available meeting rooms based on the selected location. It defines a `get_room` function that retrieves the rooms associated with the chosen location and displays them on the page.

## Date Selection and Availability Check

When a date is selected, the code checks if the selected date is a valid reservation date. It considers factors such as the library's opening hours, holidays, and existing reservations. The `check_dates` function is responsible for iterating through potential time slots and determining their availability.

## Time Slot Suggestion

The `suggest_available` function is called to display the available time slots for the selected meeting room and date. It formats the time slots and allows the user to select a desired reservation time.

## Form Submission

Once a valid meeting room, date, and time are selected, the code enables the submit button, allowing the user to submit the reservation request.

## Admin and Internal User Roles

The code checks the user's roles (anonymous, meeting rooms administrator, or internal) and adjusts the UI and validation accordingly. Admin and internal users have additional privileges, such as an extended date range for reservations.

## Event Handlers

Various event handlers are set up to respond to user interactions, such as changing the selected location, date, duration, or clicking on available time slots.

Overall, this code provides a comprehensive solution for handling meeting room reservations, including date validation, availability checks, user role management, and dynamic UI updates.
